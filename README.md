## What is TTYSH?

Turn the Arch Linux Console and tty into a blazingly fast and minimal Linux desktop.

TTYSH is a script that gives the TTY back to the user. Using automation and the Linux framebuffer, TTYSH turns your TTY into a full "desktop" with a graphical web browser, video playback, image viewing, just to name a few, and all of this is possible without a graphical environment.
